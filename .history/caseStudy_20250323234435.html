            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                For many individuals and families in low-income brackets, grocery shopping is more than just a routine
                task—it’s a constant struggle to balance affordability, nutrition, and variety.
                With food prices on the rise, finding the best deals is crucial, yet it can be time-consuming to compare
                flyers and hunt for savings. Additionally, even when discounts are found, deciding what meals to cook
                with limited ingredients can be overwhelming.
                WhatSupper addresses these challenges by simplifying the process. By automatically identifying grocery
                deals and suggesting meals based on available discounts, the app helps users maximize their budget while
                minimizing the stress of meal planning.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
