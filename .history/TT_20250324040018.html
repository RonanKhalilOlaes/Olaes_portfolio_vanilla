            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                To tackle these challenges, we developed WhatSupper, an AI-powered app designed to save both money and

                By simply taking a picture of a grocery flyer, users can instantly access tailored recipe suggestions

                The app leverages AI to analyze deals, recommend budget-friendly meals, and streamline meal planning for
                ultimate convenience and efficiency.
